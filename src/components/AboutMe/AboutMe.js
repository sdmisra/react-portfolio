      Though it has long been a dream of mine to go into software development, it took me a little while to truly chase after that dream in earnest. This portfolio represents the earliest iterations of my skillset in many ways, yet I am quite proud of my work so far and it is a joy to share it.

      <p className='about-paragraph'>
      Most recently, my career centered around speciality cheeses in a high volume retail setting. While challenging work throughout the holidays and the COVID19 pandemic particularly, I find those experiences have helped inform my considerations of the end user of my software in very practical ways.

      <p className='about-paragraph'>
      I am very eager to continue learning, and I find I thrive in a collaborative environment in which I can ask questions, reach out for perspective and context, and acknowledge my errors in a proactive way.

      Please don't hestitate to reach out if you are looking for a software developer for projects and opportunities large and small.
